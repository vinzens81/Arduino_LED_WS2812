# Arduino_LED_WS2812
Control WS2812 LED with arduino and 2 Poti (color&amp;lightness)

you need to import Libraries 
LiquidCrystal_I2C.h and
LiquidCrystal_I2C.h
into your IDE

i used an i2c display to read values. This is not needed for LED usage. (just delete all the i2c and display things)

The analog read with USB and external power connected is broken. In this cases i have never reached 100% readout. So i just disconnected USB for testing
